# Hospital-Management-System
Due to the Corona virus pandemic, hospitals have become ever so important in our lives. Hospitals have always been a necessity for mankind, since it helps in the recovery of injuries,which are both mental and physical. On the issue of appointments, mostly during the covid-19 spread, most of the hospitals were not able to handle so many patients that were pouring every now and then. The appointment system had failed in many hospitals, leading to confusion of available beds for treatment of patients.

Keeping that situation in mind, the team decided to make a hospital management system which focused mainly on emergency appointment placement. For people wanting to place an appointment in urgency, they just need to fill in their details on the appointments page and confirmation of the appointment being placed will be provided. The project required usage of python's micro web framework-Flask for the back-end, HTML for front-end and MySQL for database management of the appointment records.

On the front end, the project consists of a homepage, which contains the name of the hospital-Hope & Care, along with the link to the appointments page and other details about the hospital. The appointments page includes the fields for the user to enter and a submit button for submission of the

record into the database. After the submission of the appointment details, a confirmation page shows up. This confirmation page includes the confirmation of the appointment placed and details of the hospital and button for going back to the homepage. These appointment details entered are securely stored in a MySQL table which when prompted to display, shows all the records entered.

The team tried its best to recreate an appointment management system with the available resources.
The setup is both user and administrator friendly. For the admin, the system is secured by a password using which she/he can update and modify the records while for the customer the welcome screen appears.
