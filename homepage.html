<p4 style="font-size: 20px;">H&C Healthcare Limited, one of the largest integrated, healthcare service provider in the country is the first hospital network to implement and monitor clinical outcomes in India. This initiative further strengthens our commitment to PATIENT CENTRICITY by striving towards continuous clinical excellence through improvement and enhancement of our clinical care services. Further, the introduction of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement [PROM] lends the voice of the patient to the entire process and helps enhance patient engagement and experience. Constant evaluation of our clinical outcomes against best available global standards motivates our medical workforce to continuously improve all aspects of our practice. H&C clinical outcomes are based on measurement of disease course and progression, quality of clinical care being provided, the success of the procedures/interventions carried out, and actual benefit perceived by the patient. Details of individual procedure outcomes as measured using internationally accepted parameters and criteria, and further validated by our clinical experts, are published here and showcase our commitment to transparency in healthcare. H&C is the FIRST to embark on the journey of publishing clinical outcomes data in the public realm. To book appointment click below:-</p4>
